# docs/BUG_LOG.md  (copy this file to that path)

**Purpose:** every error, bug, failed test, failed command, regression, environment problem or surprising behaviour hit while working on this repo, **with the solution that was actually applied** (or the status if unsolved). Decisions and normal implementation go in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`; link the two by ID.

## Rules
1. **Log it when it happens**, not at the end. Open the entry as soon as you hit the problem; fill in the fix when you have it. If you end a session with it unsolved, leave it `Open` with what you tried.
2. **Append-only.** Newest first. Don't delete entries or rewrite history. If a "fix" turns out to be wrong, change `Status` to `Reopened` in a new "Update" line inside the entry, and describe the new attempt; keep the old attempt.
3. **Include the real error text** (trimmed to the relevant lines) and the exact command. **Never paste secrets, tokens, connection strings, real personal data or document contents**; redact them.
4. **Record failed attempts too.** They stop the next agent repeating them.
5. **Root cause before "fixed".** `Fixed` requires a root cause statement and a test or command that now passes; otherwise use `Workaround` or `Open`.
6. **Add a regression test** for every fixed bug (repo rule: every fixed bug gets a test) and name it in the entry.
7. Severity: `S1` data loss / security / wrong regulatory outcome / audit integrity · `S2` feature broken, no workaround · `S3` feature degraded, workaround exists · `S4` cosmetic / docs.
8. Status: `Open` · `Investigating` · `Workaround` · `Fixed` · `Reopened` · `Won't fix` (needs a human to approve) · `Not reproducible`.
9. Anything that could affect safety rules (audit tampering, authz bypass, a model changing state, secret leak) is `S1` and must be reported to a human immediately in your response, not just logged.

### BUG-XXXX — <short title>
- Date found / found by (human or agent + model) / branch / commit:
- Severity / Area (auth, workflow, rules, ocr, llm, db, migration, audit, frontend, ci, deploy, docs):
- Status:
- Where it showed up (command, endpoint, screen, test ID):
- Expected behaviour:
- Actual behaviour:
- Exact error output (trimmed, redacted):
- Steps to reproduce:
- Environment (OS, Python/Node versions, DB: SQLite/Postgres/Supabase, relevant env flags — no secrets):
- Hypotheses tried and what each showed (including ones that failed):
- Root cause:
- Solution applied (what changed, files, and why this fix rather than alternatives):
- Verification (exact command + result; regression test name/path):
- Side effects / follow-ups / related decisions (DEC-XXXX) / related IMPL-XXXX:
- Update history (date — change in status or approach):

### BUG-0001 — Tesseract binary missing, OCR tests skipped (seed entry from the technical specification)
- Date found: reported in spec v0.1 (26 Oct 2026) / found by: prior local run / commit: unknown
- Severity: S3 / Area: ocr / Status: Workaround
- Where it showed up: `make test` — historical report: 154 passed, 2 skipped, 1 warning
- Expected: OCR tests run; if the binary is absent the app degrades with an honest warning and never marks a document compliant
- Actual: 2 tests skipped because Tesseract was missing
- Root cause: host binary not installed (`brew install tesseract` on macOS; apt on Ubuntu)
- Solution applied: install Tesseract on the dev/CI host, or document it as optional and keep the skip explicit
- Verification: **not yet rerun** — rerun `make test`, record counts and skips
- Follow-ups: decide whether Tesseract is required or optional in CI (log as a DEC entry)
